If you have not previously created a Cloud Object Storage instance in your IBM Cloud account, you can create one now by clicking Add . Note: If you do have an existing storage service, select it from the drop down list and click the Create button. A new tab opens up, where you can create the Cloud Object Service. By default, a Lite (Free) plan will be selected. Scroll down and update the name of your Cloud Object Storage service if you wish, and click Create . The browser tab will automatically close when the Cloud Object Storage instance has been created. Back on IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, click Refresh . The newly created Cloud Object Storage instance will now be displayed under \"Storage\". Click Create to finish creating the project.

You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the Run button at the top of the notebook or hitting the keyboard short cut to run the cell (Shift + Enter but can vary based on platform). While the cell is running, an asterisk ( [*] ) will show up to the left of the cell. When that cell has finished executing a sequential number will show up (i.e. [17] ).","title":"Load and Run a Notebook"},{"location":"work-with-dataframe/","text":"Working with Pandas DataFrames \u00b6 Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney.
