According to Citibanks executive team (  and  ), Citibank had been issuing me permanent credits, but when a merchant disagreed, they were also paying the merchant. Then, they would charge the amount off on their P & L sheets and would code my dispute as misrepresented. To date, Citibank has not provided me with a full list of the so-called misrepresented disputes despite asking them in writing through their billing disputes department, asking for the documentation through the CFPB, as well as verbally asking for documentation to their  number within their billing disputes department. I get contradictory answers. \\nI have spoken to the store manager, , at the   .

I told him I had withdrawn dispute  for {$29.00} and asked him to directly refund me. He stated he couldnt do a refund this far along on my credit card, but he agreed to send me a gift certificate with a receipt, and said he would be willing to speak to Citibank if needed. I explained the entire problem to him and he went as far to research it through their accounting department. On , I received a gift card for {$44.00} which is well over the disputed amount. It appears he refunded me for both charges despite telling him Citibank had not paid them on the other dispute. \\nSo, I am asking that Citibank recode the disputes to reflect them as not misrepresented. I am sending a copy of the e-mail I am sending to billing disputes, copies of the gift card and the receipt ( feel free to call the number on the back of the card to verify the dollar amount ), screen prints of my dispute summary for the disputes, and a copy of the e-mail interaction between myself, , and . \\nI am also asking for full dispute documentation with the merchants response on both disputes.
